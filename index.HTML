        <div class="Bladebreakers"></div><br>
        <p>Kai is from Beyblade: G-Revolution and his team's name is the "Bladebreakers" that consists of Tyson, Max, Kenny, Ray etc. He has one of the scared Bit-Beast in his beyblade called "Dranzer". He originally wanted to destroy all Beyblades as he mistakenly believed that they stole his father away from him, leading to a deep hatred of all Beyblades. After finding out that wasn't true, Kai has proven that he has a soft side but his attitude remains mostly the same as before. </p>
